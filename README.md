# Shredder
Scope: 
    Features I want to add to my existing Shredder App
        - Add multiple resorts other than just Keystone
            - Just start with Colorado resorts and expand to the US if I have time
            - Could start with Epic resorts vs Ikon Pass resorts
        - Add favorites/rating trail feature
        - Allow users to upload their own trails
            - Add categories to trail model
                - groomers
                - off-piste backcountry
                - hikable from resort

                - tree run
                - moguls
                - terrain park
        - Allow users to display results based on trail category at each resort
        - Expand the weather forecast to display more days of the week possibly with more data
        - Allow users to upload photos of the trails
        - Use firebase to have a chat/forum on each resort's page for users to chat, etc.
        - Try to find an avalanche or dangerous conditions-like api that will render if that particular area is having an avalanche warning
        - Revamp layout with boostrap or reactstrap adding more responsive features to improve overall appearance and demonstrate   react's capabilities
    
User Stories:
    Our users our avid snowboarders/skiers looking to plan their day on the mountain, connect with other riders, scope out potential runs, evaluate different resorts in their area, and even plan vacations

Wireframes: Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a paper prototype to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
Data Models: Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
Milestones: Divide your work into parts - the most essential features for your MVP, features that are important but not essential, and features that can be saved for a later iteration. Create 3-5 major milestones with dates outlining when you expect essential features will be done.
Feasibility Study: If you're using an external API or scraping a website, make sure you can get that data. If you're using a new language, framework, or tool, go through its getting started tutorial. We will ask to see your results.
















A Snowboarding/Skiing app that allows users to rate &amp; review their favorite runs. Using data from a snow report API allows them to see current and upcoming snow conditions at their favorite mountains. <br>

MVP:<br>
Allow users to create a profile and select trails as their 'favorite' or rank them.<br>
Use a weather/OnTheSnow API to display the current snow conditions and upcoming forecast<br>
Upload a resorts trails into the backend myself.<br>
Display a list of all the trails with the trail map.<br><br>


Bonus:<br>
Allow users to upload their own trails<br>
Have a Resort/Mountain model that houses all the trails for that mountain<br>
Upload multiple resorts and all their trails on the backend<br>
Allow users to leave reviews on the trails<br>
Upload pictures on the trail's page<br>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
